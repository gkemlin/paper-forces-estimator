Julia code for asymptotic estimators for quantites of interest in electronic
structure. It can be used to reproduce the main results from our paper
_Practical error bounds for properties in plane-wave electronic structure
calculations_ by Éric Cancès, Geneviève Dusson, Gaspard Kemlin and Antoine
Levitt, available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01470).

# Requirements:
Julia 1.7 with the libraries:
- [DFTK.jl](https://dftk.org) v0.5.0 for the simulation environment;
- LinearAlgebra, IterativeSolvers, LinearMaps, FFTW for the linear algebra
  related computations;
- HDF5 for saving results.
