Julia code for asymptotic estimators for quantites of interest in electronic
structure. It can be used to reproduce the main results from our paper
_Practical error bounds for properties in plane-wave electronic structure
calculations_ by Éric Cancès, Geneviève Dusson, Gaspard Kemlin and Antoine
Levitt, available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01470).

# Requirements:
Julia 1.7 with the libraries:
- [DFTK.jl](https://dftk.org) v0.5.0 for the simulation environment;
- LinearAlgebra, IterativeSolvers, LinearMaps, FFTW for the linear algebra
  related computations;
- HDF5 for saving results.

# Usage
To perform the computations, first open the Julia shell with `julia --project`
from the location of this repository and then run
```
using Pkg
Pkg.instantiate()
```

Then, you can run all the computations at once with
`include("run_all_computations.jl")`.
